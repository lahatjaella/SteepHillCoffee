# Steep Hill Coffee Co-op Starter Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Steep Hill Coffee Co-op starter project. This project involves creating a responsive and visually appealing website for Steep Hill Coffee Co-op, focusing on various sections including the navbar, intro section, mission statement, and partners section.

## Overview

This project covers several key tasks to enhance the website's usability and aesthetic appeal. The enhancements include adding a navbar, styling the intro section, improving the mission statement section, and creating an image slideshow for the partners section. Additionally, the font styling and color palette were adjusted to match the company's theme.

## Features and Improvements

### Navbar
- **Responsive Navbar:** Added a navbar with links to different sections of the page, which collapses into a button on mobile devices for easy navigation.
- **Dark Theme:** Implemented a dark-themed navbar with a black-ish background and white text for a sleek look.
- **Branding:** Displayed "Steep Hill" in large letters on the left side of the navbar, with a coffee cup icon added before the text for branding.

### Intro Section
- **Highlight Co-op Name:** Made the name of the co-op stand out prominently from the other text.
- **Centered Text:** Centered all text in this section and added ample space above and below for a clean layout.
- **Styled Button:** Enhanced the button appearance, making it green for better visibility and aesthetics.
- **Background Image:** Used a picture of coffee beans from the assets folder as the background image for this section.

### Our Mission Section
- **Centered Heading:** Centered the "Our Mission" heading to create a focal point.
- **Breathing Room:** Ensured the text has sufficient padding, preventing it from touching the edges of the screen or adjacent sections.
- **Responsive Design:** Verified that the text looks good on mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Partners Section
- **Image Slideshow:** Transformed this section into an image slideshow using three pictures from the assets folder. Each image displays with a text blurb, and users can click an arrow to navigate to the next image.

### Additional Improvements

- **Color Palette:** Changed the color palette to match the Steep Hill Coffee Co-op's branding, creating a cohesive look and feel.
